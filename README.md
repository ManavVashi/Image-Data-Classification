# Image-Data-Classification

* This project aims to develop a sport image classification system using convolutional neural networks (CNNs). The system will be able to recognize different types of sports from images, such as soccer, basketball, tennis, etc.   The system will use a pre-trained CNN model as a feature extractor and a classifier layer on top of it. The system will be trained and evaluated on a large dataset of sport images collected from various sources. The project     will demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of CNNs for sport image classification tasks.
